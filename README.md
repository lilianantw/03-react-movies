# react-movies-styles

🎨 CSS Modules for the “React Movie Gallery” homework from the React + TypeScript course.

This repository contains **ready-to-use styles** for the components used in the Movie Gallery project. Students should copy these `.module.css` files into their own project after creating the corresponding components manually.

## How to use

2. Create each component in `src/components/`, following the structure above.
3. Copy the `.module.css` files from this repository into the appropriate folders.
4. Use the provided class names in your JSX.
